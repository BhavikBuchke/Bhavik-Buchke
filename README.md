## Hi, I’m Bhavik Buchke 👋

I’m a data science learner who enjoys working with real datasets, breaking models, fixing them, and understanding why things work (or don’t). Most of my projects are hands-on and learning-driven, focused on turning raw data into meaningful insights rather than just polished results.

# 💫 About Me

#### 🔭 Currently working on:
Multiple hands-on data science projects, including my Cisco Data Science repository (to strengthen fundamentals through structured practice) and a stock price prediction project using LSTM, where I experiment with time series data and forecasting techniques.

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on:
Beginner-to-intermediate data science or ML projects where learning by doing is the goal—cleaning messy data, experimenting with models, and improving together.

### 🧠 Looking for help with:
Writing cleaner ML pipelines, improving evaluation for time series problems, and understanding what actually makes a model reliable beyond just accuracy metrics.

### 🌱 Currently learning:
Core data science concepts, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and gradually moving deeper into machine learning and deep learning (especially LSTMs).

### 💬 Ask me about:
Python for data analysis, EDA notebooks, Cisco Data Science exercises, stock market datasets, or learning data science through self-projects and trial-and-error.
