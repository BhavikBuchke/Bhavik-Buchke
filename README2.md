# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently working on<br>Multiple hands-on data science projects, including my LSTM-based stock price prediction project and the Cisco Data Science repository, where I’m strengthening my foundations through practical exercises and real datasets.<br><br>I’m looking to collaborate on<br>Beginner-to-intermediate data science or ML projects where the focus is learning by doing—cleaning data, experimenting with models, and figuring things out together.<br><br>I’m looking for help with<br>Writing cleaner ML pipelines, improving model evaluation for time series problems, and understanding what actually makes a model reliable beyond just accuracy.<br><br>I’m currently learning<br>Core data science concepts through the Cisco DS repo, along with deeper exploration of Python, EDA, feature engineering, and LSTM models for forecasting.<br><br>Ask me about<br>Python for data analysis, EDA notebooks, stock market datasets, LSTM struggles, or learning data science through structured repos and self-projects.<br><br>Fun fact<br>Most of my learning happens when something breaks—and I don’t stop until I understand why it broke.
